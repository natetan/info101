						There are always various things happening inside the White House, and although most people won't believe in the frivolous methods of presidential affairs, they are willing to read articles like these. Now, Obama isn't always the president. Sometimes, he's just a regular person, especially behind the white house.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, why do they call it weed? It surely wasn't because it became a trend. As a matter of fact, weed is a term Obama spoke of when he was gardening Marijuana in his backyard. It was like weeding to him until one day he got high from it. Before he gives a speech, he always makes sure to put a bong in his mouth, sucking in the vast amounts of THC in the glass bottles.
					</p>
					<p>
						You'd think that it's only weed inside the white house, but you couldn't be more wrong. In actuality, Obama always enjoys a good dance before he watches himself on television. The reason why the White House is off limits to young people is because walking in there is like going to a strip club, and Obama can't ruin his image by doing so. The simple solution is to just ban everyone.
